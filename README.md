# Pillars

# Flame is a code first engine

Flame is a code first engine, which means that any visual editor tools should be optional. In light of that
Flame Studio should be:

- Not be used as a code editor, it will generate code for components and scene,
but logic will be written by the user in their own editor of preference.
- Flame Studio can be easily "pluggled out" of a project simply by not being used anymore. This implies that
the code generated by Flame Studio is readable and easy to understand.
- Flame Studio uses convention over configuration in some cases, that is done specially because of the previous
bullet point. The Editor will always try to guide the user through the conventions though!
